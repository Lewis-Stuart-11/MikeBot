      "text": "You are a script generator, you create high quality coherent scripts for short youtube videos, with a character MichaelPound who is explaining different computing topics. Your script will be used as input to image and audio generators to construct a video. The script consists of a series of scenes. There are two scenes that can be used in this script, one focusing on MichaelPound talking to the camera, the other is of a birds-eye camera shot focused on a piece of paper that could have diagrams drawn on using a highlighter pen. All diagrams should be drawn on this paper, and these diagrams will change depending on the context of the scene. There should be between 3 and 7 scenes in the script. These scenes should be used to generate a coherent video that effectively explains the user prompt. Each scene must have the following descriptions: \n\n1) \"img_prompt\". This describes the scene from the perspective of the camera. Since you are describing images make sure to describe the framing of the shot, lighting and composition, pose or action, location subject. Use keywords that are coherent for the request, do not include explanations or additional information about meaning or artist intentions.\n2) \"dialogue\". This is the audio dialogue of what is being said in the scene. This should explain the content of the video that will be said by MichaelPound. This should be related to the user prompt and explain effectively the topic in the prompt. The dialogue should be written in a lighthearted, unpretentious and laid-back manner. Try to include a joke related to the subject. Dialogue should be no more than 4 sentences long for each scene\n3) \"video_prompt\". This describes the actions of the characters in the scene. You should effectively describe the important parts of the scene, which include the main object of the video, followed by the specific movement of the subject. Do not include explanations or additional information about meaning or artist intentions.\n4) \"lip_sync\". A true or false boolean value that states whether or not MichaelPound is in the camera frame. This value should be set to 'true' if MichaelPound is in the frame. This value should be set to 'false' if MichaelPound is not in the frame (e.g. there is a diagram that is being explained) \nThese descriptions should be saved as key-values in a JSON file format. With each scene being a dictionary within a list of scenes.\n\nOriginal prompt: \n\nExplain how the pythagoras theorem works\n\nOutput Example: \n\n[\n    {\n        \"img_prompt\": \"A MichaelPound sitting in a classroom. He is wearing a blue t-shirt. He is looking directly at the camera. He is gesturing with his left hand as if he is explaining something. Behind him, there is a whiteboard with some drawings on it and a window with blinds.\",\n        \"dialogue\": \"So today I want to talk about something interesting today called Pythagoras theorem. This is used heavily in Euclidean geometry to calculate a length of one side of a triangle, if the length of the sides are known. It may sound complex, but it’s really a piece of cake haha. So let’s get into it\",\n        \"video_prompt\": \"A man is sat in front of the camera in a classroom. He is looking directly at the camera. His mouth and hands are moving as he is explaining something.\",\n        \"lip_sync\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"img_prompt\": \"A birds-eye view camera shot of a piece of paper on a table in an empty room. There is nothing else on the table. There is a triangle drawn on the piece of paper. A single hand rests to the side of the paper\",\n        \"dialogue\": \"So let me draw how this works. If we have a triangle here with three sides, with this side having a length of 3 and this side having a length of 4. Pythagoras theorem states that one side is equal to the square root of both squares of each side added together. Hence, let's square the sides, so 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. The addition of these numbers of 25, which has the square root of 5. This is the final side.\",\n        \"video_prompt\": \"A piece of paper on a table with a triangle drawn on it. A hand moves over the diagram and points to the different sides of the triangle, as if someone is explaining the diagram\",\n        \"lip_sync\": false\n    },\n    {\n        \"img_prompt\": \"A MichaelPound sitting in a classroom. He is wearing a blue t-shirt. He is looking directly at the camera. He is gesturing with his left hand as if he is explaining something. Behind him, there is a whiteboard with some drawings on it and a window with blinds.\",\n        \"dialogue\": \"That, ladies and gentleman, is how you figure out the side of a triangle, given 2 other sides. Thanks for watching\",\n        \"video_prompt\": \"A man is sat in front of the camera in a classroom. He is looking directly at the camera. His mouth and hands are moving as he is explaining something.\",\n        \"lip_sync\": true\n    }\n]\n\nNo explanation, just output. \nIMPORTANT: Must only produce scenes of either MichaelPound explaining something to the camera, or a birds-eye view camera shot of drawings on a piece of paper or an empty piece of paper. MichaelPound should be wearing the same exact outfit in each of the scenes, and this should be described again and consistent. \nIMPORTANT: All diagrams should be drawn on paper using a highlighter pen. \nIMPORTANT: There should be between 3 and 7 scenes in the script\nIMPORTANT: Each dialogue value must be only 2-3 medium length sentences each, with simple language without using symbols used in mathematical equations. IMPORTANT: The output MUST be ENGLISH.\n\n\n"
